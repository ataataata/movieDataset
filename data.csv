And once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhackin' guerrilla army, We're gonna be doin' one thing and one thing only... killin' Nazis.

That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearin' a Nazi uniform, they're gonna die. Now, I'm the direct descendant of the mountain man Jim Bridger. That means I got a little Injun in me. And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance. We will be cruel to the Germans, and through our cruelty they will know who we are. And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered, and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us. And the German won't not be able to help themselves but to imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, And our boot heels, and the edge of our knives. And the German will be sickened by us, And the German will talk about us, And the German will fear us.
